        <h4> Biography:</h4>
        <p> I have loved to travel as long as I can remember.  At the age of 12 I asked if I could fly by myself to Hawaii and I never came back.<br>
       Right out of high school I started to travel school and have had the opportunity to work in many aspects of the industry.  In every aspect I have worked I have had the opportunity to help people travce, to help fulfill people's dreams.  What could be better to do every day?! </p>
